= ShouldaDeferred

ShouldaDeferred is a take on a few shoulda extensions to defer context and 
should blocks, like xshould and xcontext.

NOTE: You will need to have Shoulda installed before you can use this plugin.


== Installation

ShouldaDeferred is available as plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/rudionrails/shoulda_deferred.git

You will need to manually require this plugin in your test helper. That is, 
because otherwise it would get automatically loaded in every environment.

# in test/test_helper.rb
require 'shoulda_deferred'

  
== Usage

You are able to put an 'x' before any shoulda macro or block in order to run it later. 

xshould will postpone a single should statement. xcontext will delay that context and
anything within the context block. You will see a " * DEFERRED... " message in the console
for all deferred test. For xcontext, you will see a deferred message for all containing
should blocks and subcontexts. This plugin also works for any other shoulda macro, like
xshould_change, xshould_validate_presence_of, xshould_respond_with, etc.


=== Examples

xshould 'do something awesome' do
  flunk "defer"
end
# => DEFERRED: SomeController should do something awesome.

xcontext 'a deferred context' do
  should 'do something' do
    flunk "defer"
  end
end
# => DEFERRED: a deferred context should do something.

xcontext 'a deferred context' do
  context 'with another subcontext' do
    should 'do something awesome' do
      flunk "defer"
    end
  end
end
# => DEFERRED: a deferred context with another subcontext should do something awesome.

context 'a regular context' do
  xcontext 'with a deferred subcontext' do
    should 'make me happy' do
      assert true
    end
  end

  should 'assert true' do
    assert true # this will run!
  end
end
# => DEFERRED: a regular context with a deferred subcontext should make me happy.

xshould_respond_with :success
# => DEFERRED: SomeController should respond with success. 

context 'a regular context' do
  xshould_render_template :index
end
# => DEFERRED: a regular context should render template index.

... and on and on and on and on...
