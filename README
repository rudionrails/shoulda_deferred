= ShouldaDeferred

ShouldaDeferred is a take on a few shoulda extensions to defer context and 
should blocks, like xshould and xcontext.

NOTE: You will need to have Shoulda installed before you can use this plugin.


== Installation

ShouldaDeferred is available as plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/rudionrails/shoulda_deferred.git


Enable this plugin by requiring shoulda_deferred in your test_helper, like so:
# in test/test_helper.rb
require 'shoulda_deferred'

  
== Usage

Then, you are able to put an 'x' before any context or should block to
postpone or delay a test. You will see a "* DEFERRED: ..." message in the 
console when running your tests. It is supposed to work for macros like 
should_render_template or should_respond_with, etc., too.


=== Examples

xshould 'do something awesome' do
  # assertions here
end
# is actually just calling the already existing should_eventually macro.
=> DEFERRED: SomeController should do something awesome.


xcontext 'a deferred context' do
  should 'do something' do
    assert true
  end
end
=> DEFERRED: a deferred context should do something.


xcontext 'a deferred context' do
  context 'with another subcontext' do
    should 'do something awesome' do
      assert true
    end
  end
end
=> DEFERRED: a deferred context with another subcontext should do something awesome.


xcontext 'a deferred context' do
  xcontext 'with a deferred subcontext' do
    should 'make me happy' do
      assert true
    end
  end
end
=> DEFERRED: a deferred context with a deferred subcontext should make me happy.


xshould_respond_with :success
=> DEFERRED: SomeController should respond with success. 


xshould_render_template :index
=> DEFERRED: ShouldaController should render template index.


... and on and on and on and on...


== Known Issues
At the moment, there is only one problem with a context which has a sub-xcontext in it. 
It is working correctly on deferring the test itself, but the output in the console 
is missing the parent context. Anyway, this will be looked at.
